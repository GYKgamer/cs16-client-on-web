So if you get an error like this one below:
-- Checking for module 'fontconfig'
--   Package 'fontconfig', required by 'virtual:world', not found
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.25/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:607 (message):
  A required package was not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-3.25/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:829 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
  3rdparty/mainui_cpp/CMakeLists.txt:103 (pkg_check_modules)

Then the fix is simple.
Step 1: run sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev in a terminal
Step 2: cd to / in terminal and run the command "find /usr/lib -name fontconfig.pc"
Step 3: Now run the command "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=(Include your path here):$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" (Make sure to change the "Include your path here" with the path you got when running step 2
Step 4: Re run the build command (in the same terminal window) and it should work
